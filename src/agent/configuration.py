2. Roadmap (no research needed)
    - mermaid markdown code for a flowchart diagram of the recommended roadmap to achieve the preparation for the topic divided into 3 sections (Fundamentals, Intermediate, Advanced)
    - Each node in the diagram should have a name of the concept

3. Main Body Sections (research needed)
    - Each section should focus on a concept that is relevant to the job description
    - Provide at least 1 structured element (either a list or a table) per section that is relevant to the concept/skill discussed in the section
    - Include at least 3 multiple choice questions per section that tests the understanding of the concept/skill discussed in the section

4. Conclusion (no research needed)
    - Aim for 1 structural element that distills the main concepts covered in the main body sections
    - Provide a concise summary of the report"""
