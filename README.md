What does API stand for:

A. Application Protocol Interface
B. Application Programming Interface
C. Automated Program Interface
D. Application Process Integration

Solution:The correct answer is (B) Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of definitions and protocols that enables two software components to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary that allows applications to talk to each other, exchange data, and share functionality
